This project is from Eric Lu's undergraduate thesis, aiming at improving the football player action valuation model VAEP, which is originally proposed by DTAI Sports Analytics Lab in KU LEUVEN, and applying the improved model to player rankings and player recruitment.

The data used are Statsbomb public event stream data from the 2015/2016 top five European leagues.
